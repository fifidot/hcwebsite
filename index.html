I thought Fiona done a great job, she was clearly very passionate about the content and delivered the workshop in an enjoyable way whilst making it very informative. I really think these are the sort of courses that should be made available to all of the staff as we are all experiencing varying levels of stress for one reason or another. I feel this information is invaluable. Thanks very much Fiona, it was very enjoyable and I feel that I gained a lot of good information and strategies.<br>
